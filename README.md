# Stargazer
A passion project where I experiment with procedural generation and unique gameplay ideas to create a first person adventure game where you can explore the outer space

*Project is developed on Unity 2019.1.10f1* 

**IMPORTANT NOTICE: This project was one of the first games that I tried to make in order to learn Unity and game development. It was also the first project that hooked me interested for more than a week. While working on it I learned lots of things so I call it a massive success BUT as I learned more and more about how to make a game, how to write clean code and how to structure a project, I have realized that this project fails in pretty much every category.** 

- It has horrible folder structure because I never thought I would work on this project more than a few days. As the project started to grow folder structure started to crumble as expected.

- When I started to work on this project the concept of "Naming Conventions" was unfamiliar to me and I didn't think it was that important since I worked solo. Well, I was wrong. The naming of the variables/functions/classes on this project doesn't follow any set of rules so they are inconsistent in many places. Don't make the same mistakes I did and learn about naming conventions. Here is a good place to start : https://www.dofactory.com/reference/csharp-coding-standards

 - Many features in this project could have implemented in much better ways. For that I'm learning about Desing Patterns so I can use them when the need arises. In short, this project requires a lot of refactoring in order to be defined as a decent one. When it comes to choosing between refactoring my old code vs embarking on a new adventure I simply choose to set sail to new projects :D
