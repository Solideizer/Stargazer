1. INTRODUCTION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flames of the Phoenix is an extensive fire fx pack contaning over 150 fire related assets. Contained within the pack you'll find everything from simple ember partical systems to complex fire prefabs.




2. HOW TO USE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two different kinds of prefabs inside of the pack, compelx prefabs as well as normal prefabs. To include a partical system in your game just simply drag the prefab into your scene from the unity explorer.




2.1 COMPLEX PREFABS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inside the pack you'll find some prefabs labeled as 'complex'. These contain more than one partical system and is instead a small group of systems (Smoke, fire, embers) that has been tweeked to fit together perfectly.



2.2 SIMPLE PREFABS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The pack also includes a huge amount of 'Simple prefabs'. These are lone partical systems that can either be used alone when you just want the single particle system, or as building blocks for new complex systems.

For example: the fire_orange_energyorb is a great asset if you want some kind of magical orb in your game and can just be added into your scene. However it can also look great if combined with other prefabs such as embers and smoke to create a more complex system.

Since the simple prefabs are lone particle systems they are much more system friendly when it comes to performance and is also a great way to implement effects like fires without cluttering up the screen with other particlesystems.



3. INCLUDED
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To make things easier for you when first opening the asset pack I have put together a list of information about each 'simple' fire particle system contained within the pack to give you a general idea of what they can be used for:



Fire_BigFire
Uses the material Fire_Material_ShortAnimation and runs the spriteanimation on the 2'nd row.
This fire is a bit bigger then the rest and is great for when you want to set an entire building ablaze.



Fire_CampFire
Uses the material Fire_Material_ShortAnimation and runs the spriteanimation on the 4'th row.
As the name implies it is modeled to look like a small campfire. Works great for when you want to give a more 'cozy' feeling with the fire.



Fire_Candle_Small
Uses the material Fire_Material_ShortAnimation and runs the spriteanimation on the 1'st row.
This particle system is tiny, really tiny. But it is a great particlesystem for when you have some small candles in your game that should be lit, while still not showing to much.
Is perfect when you have a small candle model, just place the particle system at the end of the wig of the candle.



Fire_Candle_Tall
Uses the material Fire_Material_ShortAnimation and runs the spriteanimation on the 1'st row.
This particle system is very similar to Fire_Candle_Small, the only difference is the height and density of the fire itself. This fire is a great way to break the monotony of to many of the same candle fires in a row (Say if you needed to fill a whole table with lit candles).



Fire_Embers
Uses the material Fire_Material_NoAnimation, no animation.
This particle system acts as rising embers. Starting of slow and bright and speeds up as they rise and fade away. This particle system is great when you combine it with a fire particle system, resulting in giving the fire a bit more "life". However the ember system itself can be used alone aswell, the emmition rate of the system is by default set to a realtive low curve but set it to a constant like 20 and increase the radius and it will look more like a magical spell effect.



Fire_Embers_Falling
Uses the material Fire_Material_NoAnimation, no animation.
As with Fire_Embers this particle system serves to simulate embers. However these embers will start like normal embers, but the gravity will force them back to the ground, where they will bounce until fading away. A great way to give a "sparkling" effect to a fire.



Fire_EnergyOrb
Uses the Material Fire_Material_NoAnimation, no animation.
The Energyorb system was first called the magmaorb and then became the plasmaorb before it was given its final name. If you look at the particle system itself you might see why it's been called all these things. When you want to give a magical feeling to your game with magical balls instead of torches that light of the dark halls, or perhaps you want your massive futuregun to fire a minisun at your enemies, then look no further than the energyorb. 



Fire_EnergyOrb_Tail
Uses the material Fire_Material_NoAnimation, no animation.
Remeber what I just wrote about firing a minisun at your enemies from your massive futuregun? Well this is probably what that minisun would look like when traveling trough the air at a 1000 miles per hourh to make your enemies demise certain.



Fire_FireBall
Uses the material Fire_Material_ShortAnimation and runs the spriteanimation on the 3'rd row.
If we're gonna have energyorbs and minisuns with tails then we sure as hell need some good old fireballs aswell!
Works great for when you want to fire away a relative simple and small particle effect as the effect of a spellcast.



Fire_FireWall
Uses the material Fire_Material_ShortAnimation and runs the spriteanimation on the 1'st row.
This particle effect simulates a firewall, not the kind that keeps your computer safe. It uses the 'shape:Box' property and is very thin at both the Y- and Z-axis while covering some space in the x-axis. Works great when put next to another Firewall to cover even more space on the x-axis. Works prefect when you want to cover an entrance or a road with fire.



Fire_Horizontal
Uses the material Fire_Material_LongAnimation and runs the spriteanimation from row 1 to 4.
Imagine a gargoyle, now remove the hooded figure with a batcostume standing on it and instead imagine the gargoyle started breathing fire. Great! Now you knwo what Fire_Horizontal is!
THe fire itself travels in a horizontal way when it first is generated, but starts to travel more towards the sky the longer the particles exist.
Great when you want a statue to start spitting fire or you want to add a fire effect to a running animation.



Fire_Living
Uses the material Fire_Material_ShortAnimation and runs the spriteanimation on the 1'st row.
The Fire_Living particle system is a bit more lively than the rest of the fires and because of the way the particle system itself is set up it seems to be a bit more caotic.



Fire_LongAnimation
Uses the material Fire_Material_LongAnimation and runs the spriteanimation from row 1 to 4.
This fire is about the size of the Fire_living, however this fire takes full use of the texture and so every particle in the fire goes trough 16 different sprites in one lifetime. Yet again a very 'caotic' fire that seems to burn very fast, but the extra sprites in each particle also makes the fire itself seem more smooth.



Fire_SharpTexture
Uses the material Fire_Material_ShortAnimation and runs the spriteanimation on the 3'rd row.
As the name implies this fire uses a very sharp texture. This leads to each flame becoming sharper and easier to see. Great when you use alot of fires in the same room and want some more defined flames in certain areas.



Fire_Side
Uses the material Fire_Material_LongAnimation and runs the spriteanimation from row 1 to 4.
Want to cover a building in fire? Want the fire on the floor to somehow be attached to the fire in the ceeling? Well that's when you use the Fire_Side. Like Fire_Wall it uses a 'Shape:Box' property, however Fire_Side only uses the Z-axis. This results in the fire seemingly climbing up the wall as the fire is trying to reach the sky. 
Is best used when you want to set fire to a wall or to create a passage in the fire that the player has to go inbetween.



Fire_SmallFire
Uses the Material Fire_Material_ShortAnimation and runs the spriteanimation on the 2'nd row.
Don't let the name fool you, this fire is only marginally smaller than Fire_Campfire and far bigger than something like Fire_Candle_Tall. However this fire is the smallest of the 'normal' fires and therefor is best used when you want a fire but dont want it to take to much focus from the rest of the environment.



4. COLORS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You might have notice that in the folder structure that when you select the folder 'simple' in fire prefabs you are prompted to choose which kind of color you would like to add.
This is because Flames of the Phoenix comes with 7 different and unique fire set color variations for all of the prefabs

	- Orange

	- Green

	- Magic

	- Ghost

	- Soul

	- Royal

	- Frost

All these variations have been tweeked to the maximum to make sure they all fit together as perfect, within each respective color group, as possible.
So whenever you decide you want a different kind of color on your fire you have a massive library of colors and fires to choose from.

This beeing said, all the particle systems in this pack takes use of the additive and alhpa shader option.
What this means is that all the colors of the fires and smoke particle systems are changeable within unity itself.

So let's say you decided you want the fire to be a bit more red rather than orange.
All you have to do is go to the inspector of that prefab, and inside of the 'particle system' tab change the 'Start Color'.
You might not yet be pleased with the result and want it to be even more red. 
Return to the inspector of the prefab and open the 'Color over Lifetime' tab. You are now presented with a gradient, where you have the option to change the color of the prefab even more.
